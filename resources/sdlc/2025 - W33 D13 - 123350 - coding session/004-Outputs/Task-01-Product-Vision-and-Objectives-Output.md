# Task 01 - Product Vision and Objectives Output

Based on the provided context files, I have extracted the following information for defining the product vision and objectives:

## Product Vision Statement
**Develop an AI-powered employee attrition prediction system that proactively identifies at-risk employees 6-24 months in advance, enabling strategic workforce planning and targeted retention interventions to reduce unexpected departures and optimize recruitment costs.**

## Business Objectives

### Primary Objective
Reduce unexpected employee departures by 25% within 12 months through AI-powered early warning predictions, achieving £200K+ annual savings in recruitment costs while improving succession planning effectiveness.

### Secondary Objectives
- Implement predictive risk scoring for all employees with 75%+ accuracy for 12-month predictions
- Reduce backfill times by 15% through proactive temporary staffing arrangements
- Enable data-driven retention strategies based on AI-generated insights and recommendations
- Establish continuous model improvement through monthly refresh cycles and feedback loops

### Success Metrics
- **Precision**: 80%+ (minimize false alarms that waste HR resources)
- **Recall**: 70%+ (catch actual departures before they occur)
- **AUC-ROC**: >0.85 (strong predictive performance)
- **Model refresh time**: <24 hours for updated risk scores
- **ROI achievement**: £200K+ annual recruitment cost savings

## Context Summary

### Industry/Domain Context
Law enforcement organization (referenced by PCSOs, call handlers, and officers requiring 2+ years training) with complex recruitment and training processes including vetting and occupational health assessments.

### Key Stakeholders and Their Needs
- **HR Managers**: Need retention strategies and early warning systems for intervention planning
- **Department Heads**: Require succession planning tools and resource allocation guidance  
- **Senior Leadership**: Need workforce strategy insights and budget justification for retention investments
- **HCM System Administrators**: Must provide clean, structured employee data for model training
- **Exit Interview Coordinators**: Need to contribute insights for model enhancement

### Current Challenges Being Addressed
- Reactive hiring approach leading to operational gaps and high recruitment costs
- Manual analysis of exit interviews providing limited predictive insight
- Ad-hoc succession planning resulting in inadequate coverage for critical roles
- 2+ year training periods for officers creating significant replacement challenges
- Lack of early warning indicators for employee departure risk

### Solution Scope and Constraints
- **Data Sources**: Structured HCM data, semi-structured PDR data, unstructured exit interview text
- **Privacy Requirements**: GDPR compliance with employee data protection and right to explanation
- **Technical Constraints**: Integration with existing Microsoft/Oracle systems, cloud-based preferred
- **Interpretability Needs**: High transparency required for HR decision-making and employee discussions
- **Processing Requirements**: Batch processing acceptable, real-time updates not critical

### Key Assumptions
- Organization uses common HCM platforms (SAP, Workday, etc.)
- Exit interviews contain both structured ratings and free text feedback
- Current recruitment costs are substantial enough to justify AI investment
- 2+ year training period applies primarily to police officers, with shorter training for other roles

## Validation Notes
This product vision aligns with the context requirements for:
- Specific AI problem identification (attrition prediction)
- Clear business value proposition (cost savings and improved planning)
- Measurable success criteria (precision, recall, ROI metrics)
- Stakeholder needs alignment (HR, management, leadership)
- Technical feasibility within stated constraints
