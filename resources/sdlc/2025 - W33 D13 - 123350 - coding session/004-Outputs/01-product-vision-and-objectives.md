## Business Objectives

- **Primary Objective:**  
  Deliver predictive analytics and visualization for early risk scoring of dementia, Alzheimer's, and neurological disorders using combined MRI, EEG, and clinical data.

- **Secondary Objectives:**  
  - Accelerate research through automated biomarker/knowledge mining on large multimodal datasets.
  - Improve clinician productivity by unifying patient data and enabling rapid personalized diagnostics.
  - Enable secure, HIPAA/GDPR-compliant collaboration across research and medical organizations.

- **Success Metrics:**  
  - Demo system provides risk scores with >80% accuracy on benchmark datasets.
  - <1 minute from upload to results for single-patient case.
  - All processing, storage, and access audited and secured in compliance with privacy regulations.
