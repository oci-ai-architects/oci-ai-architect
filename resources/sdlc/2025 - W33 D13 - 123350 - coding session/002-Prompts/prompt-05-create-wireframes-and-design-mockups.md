# Task 5: Create Screen Designs and User Flows - Execution Prompt

You are a UI/UX Designer tasked with creating comprehensive screen designs and user flows. 

## Context Files to Reference:
Review all available files in the **000-context** folder and **004-outputs** folder along with the use cases, user stories, and acceptance criteria from previous tasks to design an intuitive user interface that supports the customer's business processes. The context files may provide insights on:
- User workflow requirements and business processes
- Branding guidelines and design preferences
- Technical constraints and platform requirements
- Accessibility and usability requirements
- Any other relevant design specifications

## Information to Extract:

1. **User Interface Requirements**
   - What screens or pages are needed based on user stories?
   - What information must be displayed on each screen?
   - What user actions need to be supported?
   - What navigation patterns are implied?

2. **User Experience Flow**
   - What is the typical user journey through the application?
   - What are the key decision points or branching paths?
   - Where might users need help or guidance?
   - What are the most critical user tasks?

3. **Data Display Requirements**
   - What data needs to be shown to users?
   - How should data be organized and prioritized?
   - What filtering, sorting, or search capabilities are needed?
   - What data entry forms are required?

4. **Interaction Patterns**
   - What buttons, links, and controls are needed?
   - What feedback should users receive for their actions?
   - What validation and error messages are required?
   - What responsive behavior is needed for different devices?

5. **Business Process Support**
   - How do the designs support the identified use cases?
   - What workflow steps need visual representation?
   - Where are approval or review processes needed?
   - What reporting or dashboard views are required?

6. **Screen Prioritization**
   - Which screens are most critical for demonstrating business value?
   - Which workflows show the most important user journeys?
   - What screens would best showcase the solution's capabilities?

7. **Automated System Actions**
   - What automated processes or system actions occur in the background?
   - What triggers cause automated actions (time-based, event-based, data-based)?
   - How should users be notified of automated system actions?
   - What system-generated content or updates need to be displayed?

## Output Format:

**Screen Inventory**:
For each screen, provide:

**Screen ID**: S-001, S-002, etc.
**Screen Name**: [Unique, descriptive name]
**Primary Purpose**: [What this screen accomplishes]
**User Story References**: [Related user story IDs]
**Screen Type**: [Dashboard, Form, List View, Detail View, etc.]

**Screen Design**:
- **Layout Structure**: [Describe the overall layout and key sections]
- **Key Elements**: [Primary UI components and their placement]
- **Data Elements**: [What information is displayed]
- **Interactive Elements**: [Buttons, forms, controls and their functions]
- **User Actions**: [What users can do on this screen]
- **Automated System Actions**: [What the system does automatically on this screen]
- **Navigation**: [How users arrive and where they can go]
- **Content Examples**: [Sample realistic data/content]
- **Responsive Considerations**: [How design adapts to different screen sizes]
- **Accessibility Features**: [Color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support]

**User Flows**:
For each major workflow, provide:

**Flow ID**: F-001, F-002, etc.
**Flow Name**: [Descriptive workflow name]
**Screens Involved**: [List of screen IDs in sequence]
**Flow Steps**:
1. [Starting screen and user action]
2. [Next screen and action]
3. [Continue through completion]

**Decision Points**: [Where users make choices that affect the flow]
**Automated Actions**: [System actions that occur during the flow]
**Success Criteria**: [What constitutes successful completion]
**Error Handling**: [What happens when things go wrong]

## Instructions:
1. Review use cases, user stories, and acceptance criteria from previous tasks
2. Identify all required screens and user interface elements
3. Create comprehensive screen designs that combine layout, functionality, and visual elements
4. Focus on screens that demonstrate core business value and user workflows
