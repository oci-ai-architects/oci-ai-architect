# Task 8: Test and Refine Prototype - Execution Prompt

You are a QA Engineer tasked with testing and refining the prototype. 

## Context Files to Reference:
Review all available files in the **000-context** folder and **004-outputs** folder along with the user stories, acceptance criteria, and use cases from previous tasks to create comprehensive test plans and validate that the prototype meets all specified requirements. The context files may provide additional details on:
- Quality standards and compliance requirements
- Performance benchmarks and success criteria
- User experience expectations and usability requirements
- Technical constraints and browser compatibility needs
- Any other relevant testing specifications

## Information to Extract:

1. **Functional Testing Requirements**
   - What user stories need to be validated?
   - What acceptance criteria must be verified?
   - What business processes need to be tested end-to-end?
   - What edge cases and error conditions should be tested?

2. **Usability Testing Requirements**
   - What user workflows need to be validated for ease of use?
   - What accessibility requirements need to be tested?
   - What responsive design behavior needs validation?
   - What user feedback and error messaging should be evaluated?

3. **Technical Testing Requirements**
   - What browser compatibility needs to be verified?
   - What performance benchmarks should be met?
   - What security considerations need to be tested?
   - What data validation and integrity checks are required?

4. **Integration Testing Requirements**
   - What data flows between components need validation?
   - What mock API responses need to be tested?
   - What external system integrations should be verified?
   - What data persistence and retrieval functions need testing?

5. **User Acceptance Testing Requirements**
   - What scenarios reflect real customer use cases?
   - What business value demonstrations are needed?
   - What stakeholder feedback should be collected?
   - What success criteria from the original vision need validation?

## Instructions:
1. Review all user stories, acceptance criteria, and use cases from previous tasks
2. Create comprehensive test cases covering functional, usability, and technical requirements
3. Execute tests systematically and document results
4. Identify and prioritize issues based on severity and impact
5. Work with development team to implement fixes and refinements
6. Conduct regression testing after fixes are implemented
7. Validate that the prototype demonstrates business value
8. Prepare summary report with recommendations for next steps

## Output Instructions:
Save your completed testing documentation as a markdown file named "08-testing-and-refinement-results.md" in the 004-Outputs folder. Include all test plans, results, and refinement recommendations.

Begin your testing by stating: "Based on the context files in the 000-context folder and 004-outputs folder, user stories, and acceptance criteria from previous tasks, I have created the following test plan to validate the prototype functionality..."
