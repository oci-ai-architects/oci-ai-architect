  # AI Context Enhancement Prompt

Analyze the provided context and expand it with the following essential
details for AI solution development:

## AI Business Problem
- What specific problem could AI/ML solve?
- What manual or inefficient processes exist?
- What patterns, predictions, or insights are needed?
- What decisions need to be automated or supported?

## AI Users and Data Stakeholders
- Who will interact with the AI system? (end users, analysts, decision
makers)
- What AI capabilities do they need? (predictions, recommendations,
automation)
- Who owns/provides the data? (data sources, quality, access)
- Who interprets AI outputs and makes decisions?

## AI Requirements
- What type of AI solution is needed? (prediction, classification,
recommendation, automation)
- What data is available? (structured/unstructured, volume, quality,
real-time needs)
- What accuracy/performance levels are required?
- What integrations with existing systems are needed?

## AI Success Criteria
