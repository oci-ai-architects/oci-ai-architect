"Chatbot, empowered by RAG and AI agents.",Romania,"Hi team,

MerlinX is a B2B travel booking platform that is planning to offer its end clients (travel agencies from the EU) the option of having a chatbot on their websites. This chatbot would generate responses using AI Agents, enhanced with RAG data sources from specific domains relevant to travel agencies, along with offers from the MerlinX system (via web services).

We've discussed several implementation options, such as ODA + custom-developed AI agents (using LangChain), or ODA + OCI Agents. However, due to the use of ODA, this solution could become a bit pricey, especially since it needs to be deployed across multiple end-customer websites (multiple ODA instances?)

From my conversation with the DS AI Team, I understand that there have been similar cases we've worked on, and that there are templates for custom RAG implementations. Also, it might be possible to offer some alternatives to ODA in this case.

2. Two types of processes:
a. Telephone support:
i. A robot receives the customer's call and assists them in a
friendly and interactive manner.
ii. Two modes of use:
• Classification/routing: The robot must gather
information about the customer and their needs in
order to route the call to the appropriate human
responder, providing the relevant information.
• Application front-end: The robot receives customer
requests, which it executes by calling application APIs
to perform queries or execute actions. For example:
checking product availability, rescheduling a delivery.
b. Email reception:
i. A robot receives customer emails and processes them.
ii. Two modes of use:
• Classification/routing: By analyzing the content of the
message, it routes it to the appropriate resolution
team.
• Application front-end: The bot extracts specific data
from the email and loads it into an application by
calling an API. For example, an email requesting a

1. Autonomous Finance ERP Agent : AI agent monitors financials, identifies anomalies, predicts cash flow, and recommends actions. e.g. “Expense Optimization Agent"" automatically flags unusual spending, suggests reclassifications, and drafts journal entries for approval.

2. Smart HR Assistants for HCM : A virtual HR agent helps employees and managers navigate processes like performance reviews, PTO planning, or compensation changes. e.g. a “Career Path Agent” suggests internal roles, training, and mentors based on employee skills and business needs.

3. Procurement Automation Agent (SCM) : agent negotiates with suppliers, drafts contracts, and alerts for potential supply chain disruptions. e.g. Automatically adjust purchase orders based on vendor lead times, risk scores, or geopolitical issues.

4. Compliance & Risk Agents : Monitors compliance with policies and regulations across  SOX, GDPR, ESG reporting. e.g, ""ESG Compliance Agent” aggregates environmental impact data across supply chain and reports issues.

Are there any usecases/demos build around these ? I am happy to re-use them or work with you to brainstorm what more could be done.

In alignment with this, DHA has prioritised the following six AI use cases for immediate evaluation and Time World role is only for advisory and pre-evaluation:
 
Early Detection and Risk Stratification – Predicting individuals at risk using clinical and non-clinical data.
Prediction of Mental Illness Incidence & Prevalence in Adults – Modelling trends to guide national strategy and service planning.
Prediction of Mental Illness in Children & Adolescents – Detecting early onset patterns through longitudinal and social determinant data.
AI Prediction of Comorbidities with Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) – Identifying high-risk patient clusters for targeted intervention.
Crisis Prediction and Management – Using real-time data to forecast psychiatric crises and enable pre-emptive support.

Can you please help me and Martin Hoffman answer this question? I think a generic “high level vision” that we could attach in the RFI would be great. The RFI comes with a short notice, so anything that we have already available is great. The RFI is quite broad, I think a high level vision could be presented as our ""plans for future development and updates of the product"". Anything that is on MLOps will be great.

VGR's RFI is to identify a solution for developing and managing one or more AI/ML applications tailored for various use cases, including decision-making, analytics, quality monitoring and assurance, as well as operational processes.

VGR is a Public Sector organization in Sweden that is serving Healthcare, Culture, Public transport, and Regional development.

They are building a Datawarehous to collect data from different data sources and they are looking for a Analytics and AI solutions on top of it.

Main Use Cases

Automated Document Interpretation/Understanding and Prescription Management
   AI and Machine Learning models can automate the extraction and interpretation of data from prescriptions and related documents, significantly reducing the time spent by staff on manual entry and organization. By improving document accuracy and legibility, AI can help minimize errors and conflicts with insurance companies, which can lead to financial losses for radiology centers and labs.

2. AI-Assisted Radiology Report Generation and Interpretation  
   AI algorithms can assist radiologists and technicians by providing real-time suggestions and insights while reading and interpreting diagnostic images, such as CT scans, X-rays, or MRIs. This support improves the accuracy and consistency of radiology reports, enhancing clinical decision-making and reducing reporting time.

3. Advanced Radiology Analytics and Descriptive Reporting  
   AI-driven analytics can automate the generation of comprehensive and descriptive reports, providing deeper insights into patient conditions and treatment outcomes. By identifying patterns and trends in diagnostic data, AI can help radiology centers deliver more precise diagnoses and enhance their value proposition to both patients and physicians.

4. AI-Generated Test Results with Actionable Insights  
   AI models cannot only generate test results but also help document them in a professional and medically accurate manner. Additionally, they can provide actionable insights based on the data, assisting doctors and technicians in interpreting the results within the context of the patientâ€™s condition. This enhances the decision-making process, ensuring that healthcare providers deliver more precise and timely care.

"Aero Vodochody",Czechia,"Background
- Aero Vodochody is a manufacturer of military training jet planes (L-39)
- they supply these jets to many NATO countries and other states
- jets are tailor made for each military
- they are used to train pilots for more advanced types including F-35, F-16

Opportunity 
- AWS tried to sell them AI for CFD and other uses 
- they were stopped by CISO as public cloud is not approved to use due to sensitive nature of the military orders
- each jet is tailor made to specific need of each airforce hence security is for them essential
- AWS tried to position Sovereign Cloud but again it failed because many customers are non NATO non EU 

Question 
1. Can we solve where AWS failed?
2. Is there for us way to offer them something that can be used locally in Czechia in their own data centre?
3. But it would have to be cheaper what they can get from hardware providers like HP, IBM, Dell and alike?

Main objective 
- Run AI including GPUs solely in the country nothing goes to any cloud outside of the country hence we can guarantee absolute security of data and process including all AI processes

- Move to Cloud: Ahmed Noui discussed Hutchinson's ongoing move to the cloud. He highlighted the challenge of finding value creation in this transition.
- Confidential Data & AI: Hutchinson's pragmatic approach to AI on confidential data. Focus on finding the right users for the right processes, and not the other way around. Importance of serious subject matter.
- Complexity, Costs, and ROI: Ahmed's interest in understanding the complexity, direct and indirect costs (training, development), and ROI of Oracle's approaches.
- Generative AI Initiatives: Observations on many GenAI initiatives leading to PoCs due to announcement effects. Need for better cost control and data learning processes.
- Data Mesh Architecture: Interest in data mesh architecture for parallel data science exploitation. Challenges with data silos at Hutchinson, with around twenty different ERPs. The need for data convergence.
- Testing Oracle Technologies: Interest in testing Oracle's technologies for data convergence. Desire to test Kubernetes approaches both in the cloud and on-premises. Request for training on containerized cloud with strong CI/CD approaches and successful production scaling.
- Partnerships and Specialization: Current partnership with Azure for AI commodities. Use of built-in AI (ERP SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft Office with AI). Potential for specialized AI, characterized by specific training for business problems. Goals for AI to be high-performing, reliable, cost-effective, and possibly hybrid (On Cloud, On Prem) for ML and learning.

Current AI / ML and use cases

https://www.cnb.cz/cs/o_cnb/cnblog/Prvni-vyuziti-AI-pri-prognozovani-inflace-v-CNB/

Why they need GPUs

They currently run on standard CPUs which is sufficient for many ML tasks but as they will be maturing using of GPUs would make more sense

What we want to offer 

- Oracle Compute Cloud @ Customer with GPU extension (Nvidia L40S)

Why?

- CNB as regualtor and custodian of Czech independent currency cannot for political reasons use cloud services in other country 
- One issue is currency itself there is a strong movement to replace czech currency (Czech Koruna) with EURO. Hence using cloud in EU country or even non EU was so far big no.
- Second issue is Czech government cyber security posture that doesn't allow use of cloud for government  

Ask

- We are meeting them and want them to get excited about Compute Cloud @ Customer with GPU extension
- it would be good to understand if we have any government references (we dont need to be specific in which country) where they are using Compute Cloud @ Customer GPUs and also describe from data science team perspective why this is better option that just run Jupier on linux servers

The ERP system automatically translates the photos and posts them on their website.

The biggest time savings they could achieve would be if they no longer had to type out the descriptions (or at least some of them) but could simply have them recognized.
To get this data into their ERP system, they have a category (e.g., passenger cars) with several mandatory fields, and some that are optional.
