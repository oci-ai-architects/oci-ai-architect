# Building Your AI Department
## A 3-Day Intensive Workshop by Frank Boughen

**Based on The Frank Method - Agentic Intelligence Framework**

**Duration:** 3 days (8 hours per day, 24 hours total)
**Format:** On-site or Virtual
**Group Size:** 8-20 participants (optimal 12)
**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of AI concepts, access to organization's systems
**Investment:** $50-150K per engagement

---

## Workshop Overview

### The Promise

**"Deploy 3-5 production-ready AI agents in 3 days, with a clear roadmap to transform your entire organization in 90 days."**

By the end of this workshop, participants will:
1. ✅ Understand The Frank Method and AGENT Blueprint framework
2. ✅ Deploy 1 fully functional AI agent to production
3. ✅ Design 3-5 additional department-specific agents
4. ✅ Create multi-agent orchestration workflows
5. ✅ Establish governance and compliance frameworks
6. ✅ Build internal capability to continue expansion independently

### Why This Works

**Traditional AI deployments fail because:**
- They take 18-24 months (too slow, priorities change)
- They start with theory instead of results (no quick wins)
- They're consultant-dependent (no knowledge transfer)
- They're not proven at personal scale (untested in real life)

**This workshop succeeds because:**
- Results in 3 days (immediate ROI, momentum)
- Hands-on deployment from hour 1 (learn by doing)
- You build it, you own it (independence from day 1)
- Based on FrankX.ai system running 24/7 (living proof)

### The Living Proof Factor

Every pattern taught in this workshop is **validated daily** through FrankX.ai:
- 6-agent personal system managing multiple businesses
- Same frameworks scaled from Fortune 500 to solo creator
- Continuous real-world testing and optimization
- When we say "this works," we're running it right now

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do we need technical expertise to participate?
**A:** Basic comfort with technology is helpful, but advanced coding skills are not required. The workshop is designed to be hands-on but accessible. We provide templates and guides that make implementation straightforward.

### Q: What if our organization uses different cloud providers or systems?
**A:** The Frank Method is built on open standards (Oracle Agent Spec), so it works with any LLM provider and integrates with any system that has APIs. We've successfully deployed with AWS, Azure, GCP, on-premise, and hybrid environments.

### Q: How long does it really take to see ROI?
**A:** You'll deploy your first agent during Day 1 of the workshop, so you can start seeing efficiency gains immediately. Measurable ROI typically appears within 4-6 months as more agents are deployed and optimized.

### Q: Is this just for large enterprises?
**A:** While our case studies feature large enterprises, The Frank Method scales down beautifully. We've worked with teams as small as 10 people. The portability principle means the same frameworks work at any scale.

### Q: What happens after the 6-month support period?
**A:** By then, you'll have internal capability to continue independently. We also offer ongoing relationships through our community of practice, annual strategic reviews, or retainer support for continued expansion.

### Q: Can we start with just one department?
**A:** Absolutely. Many clients start with a pilot (Finance or Support are popular), prove ROI, then expand. The workshop designs your full portfolio, but you control the deployment pace.

### Q: How is this different from hiring a consulting firm like McKinsey or Deloitte?
**A:** Traditional firms deliver recommendations and implementations that you don't fully understand or own. We teach you the methodology and build it with you, so you own it completely. Plus, we're 5-10x faster and the approach is validated through FrankX.ai.
