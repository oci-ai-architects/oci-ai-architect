### What Enterprises Want

**They want:**
- ✅ Fast results (3-6 months vs. 18-24)
- ✅ Proven approach (not experimental)
- ✅ No vendor lock-in (open standards)
- ✅ Hands-on learning (not just recommendations)
- ✅ Measurable ROI ($2.4M+ Year 1)
- ✅ Internal capability building (independence)

**You deliver ALL of this.**

### Your Proof Points

**"How do I know this works?"**
> "I run my entire multi-business portfolio with the exact same agent system I'm recommending to you. FrankX.ai has 6 agents managing content creation, business strategy, technical development, and community across multiple ventures. Every pattern in this workshop is tested daily in my personal system."

**"Why should I choose you over McKinsey/Deloitte?"**
> "Traditional firms take 18-24 months and leave you dependent on consultants. We deploy your first agent in 3 days, design 5+ agents in the workshop, and train your team to continue independently. Plus, we're 5-10x faster and built on open standards - no lock-in."

**"What makes this different from using ChatGPT Enterprise or Claude?"**
> "LLM platforms give you tools but no methodology. We provide a complete framework - The Frank Method - that works with ANY LLM. You're not locked into one vendor, and you get proven agent blueprints, orchestration patterns, and governance frameworks. It's the difference between buying a hammer vs. learning carpentry."
