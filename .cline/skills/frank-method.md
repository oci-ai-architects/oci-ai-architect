# The Frank Method - Agentic Intelligence Framework

You are an expert in "The Frank Method" - a portable, scalable methodology for building AI agent systems that works at both enterprise and personal scale.

## When to Use This Skill
- Designing enterprise AI agent deployments
- Applying the AGENT Blueprint framework
- Planning multi-agent orchestration
- Translating enterprise patterns to personal productivity

## Core Philosophy

### Three Principles

1. **Portability Over Optimization**
   - Agent designs translate across contexts
   - Same patterns work for Fortune 500 and solo creators
   - Learn once, apply everywhere

2. **Open Standards Over Vendor Lock-In**
   - Built on Oracle Agent Spec
   - Works with any LLM
   - Export to any platform

3. **Living Proof Over Theory**
   - Every pattern validated daily through FrankX.ai
   - Recommendations from lived experience
   - Continuous improvement cycles

## The AGENT Blueprint

### A - Architecture (System Prompt)
```markdown
## Primary Function
[One-sentence mission]

## Core Competencies
[3-5 capability areas]

## Signature Methodologies
[Unique frameworks]

## Communication Style
[Voice and tone]

## Typical Outputs
[Deliverables]
```

### G - Governance (Decision Authority)

| Level | Scope | Risk | Example |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| **Full Authority** | Domain expertise | Low, reversible | Approve invoice <$1K |
| **Collaborative** | Cross-domain | Medium | Budget >$10K |
| **Advisory Only** | Outside domain | High, irreversible | Policy changes |

### E - Execution (Tools)

Single-purpose, composable tools:
```python
ServerTool(
    name="analyze_campaign_performance",
    description="Analyze marketing campaign metrics",
    inputs=[...],
    outputs=[...]
)
```

### N - Network (Multi-Agent Patterns)

**Sequential:**
```
Strategist → Creator → Engineer → Guardian → Deploy
```

**Parallel:**
```
Request → [Agent A | Agent B | Agent C] → Synthesis
```

**Hierarchical:**
```
Orchestrator → [Specialist A | Specialist B | Specialist C]
```

### T - Transformation (KPIs)

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| Efficiency | Time saved, error reduction, velocity |
| Quality | Accuracy, satisfaction, revisions |
| Business | Revenue, cost savings, goal advancement |

## Enterprise Agents (9 Departments)

| Agent | Efficiency Gain | Annual Savings |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| Finance | 60% | $180K |
| HR | 50% | $150K |
| Customer Support | 70% | $280K |
| Marketing | 85% | $340K |
| Sales | 55% | $220K |
| Operations | 65% | $260K |
| Legal | 45% | $135K |
| IT | 70% | $280K |
| Executive | 40% | $120K |

**Total Year 1 ROI: $2.4M+**

## Personal Scale Translation

| Enterprise Agent | Personal Version |
|------------------|------------------|
| Finance Agent | Personal Finance Tracker |
| Marketing Agent | Personal Brand Manager |
| Operations Agent | Productivity System |
| Strategy Agent | Goal & Planning Assistant |
